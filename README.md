This repository contains the Terraform code and GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the Medusa open-source headless commerce platform backend on AWS using ECS/Fargate. 
The setup includes an automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the Medusa backend on every code change.
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Provision Infrastructure: Use Terraform to set up the necessary AWS resources, including a VPC, ECS cluster, Fargate tasks, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and supporting infrastructure.
Deploy Medusa Backend: Automatically deploy the Medusa backend on AWS ECS using Fargate.
Set Up CI/CD Pipeline: Automate the build and deployment process using GitHub Actions.
Architecture
The deployment architecture includes the following components:

VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones.
ECS Cluster: An Amazon ECS cluster that runs the Medusa backend using Fargate.
Fargate Tasks: Task definitions specifying the Docker container for the Medusa backend.
ALB: An Application Load Balancer that routes traffic to the ECS tasks.
Security Groups: Security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to the ECS tasks and ALB.
